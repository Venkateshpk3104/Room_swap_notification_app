# Hostel Room Swap Notification App

## Project Overview

This project aims to solve the issue of hostel roommate dissatisfaction by allowing candidates (students) to express interest in swapping rooms and notifying them in-app when someone is interested in their room. The notification system is built within the app, avoiding external email notifications, and it provides real-time updates for a smooth and efficient experience.

---

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: 
  Candidates can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
  
- **Room Allocation System**: 
  Each candidate is mapped to their current and past roommates.

- **Room Swap Interest**: 
  Candidates can express interest in swapping rooms with others.

- **In-App Notification System**: 
  Candidates are notified when someone shows interest in their room, with real-time updates.

- **Notification Management**: 
  Notifications can be viewed and marked as read/unread within the app.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- **Framework**: React.js or Next.js
- **State Management**: React Context or Redux (optional)
- **UI Library**: Custom CSS or Tailwind CSS

### Backend:
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js or Python with Flask/Django
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL/MySQL (SQL)
  
### Real-Time Communication:
- **Socket.IO** for real-time notifications

### Deployment:
- **Frontend**: Vercel or Netlify
- **Backend**: Heroku or Render.com
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas or ElephantSQL

## Features Description

### 1. **User Registration and Login**
   - Users can register with a username, email, and password.
   - Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt**.
   - Authentication is handled via **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.

### 2. **Room Management**
   - Each candidate is mapped to a room and previous roommates.
   - Admin can manually assign rooms or users can update their room allocation.

### 3. **In-App Notifications**
   - When someone shows interest in a candidate's room, a notification is created in the database and pushed to the candidate in real-time.
   - Users can view, mark as read, and manage notifications in-app.

### 4. **Real-Time Notifications (Socket.IO)**
   - **Socket.IO** is integrated for real-time notifications.
   - Candidates receive instant updates when someone is interested in their room.

---

## API Endpoints

### User Authentication
- `POST /register`: Register a new candidate.
- `POST /login`: Log in the user and return a token.
- `GET /profile`: Get user details.

### Room Management
- `GET /rooms`: Fetch all rooms.
- `POST /rooms`: Create or update room allocations.

### Notifications
- `GET /notifications?userId`: Fetch notifications for the user.
- `POST /notifications`: Create a notification when a user shows interest in a room.
- `PUT /notifications/:id`: Mark a notification as read.

---

## Database Design

### **User Model**
```
User {
  id: String,
  email: String,
  password: String,
  currentRoom: RoomId,
  previousRoommates: [UserId]
}
```

### **Room Model**
```
Room {
  id: String,
  occupants: [UserId]
}
```

### **Notification Model**
```
Notification {
  id: String,
  userId: String,
  message: String,
  isRead: Boolean,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

---

## Real-Time Notification Flow

1. **Interest Expressed**: 
   When a candidate shows interest in another candidate’s room, the backend creates a notification for the current occupant of that room.

2. **Notification Creation**: 
   The notification is stored in the `notifications` collection with `userId`, `message`, `isRead`, and `createdAt` fields.

3. **Real-Time Notification (Socket.IO)**: 
   If the occupant is online, they will receive the notification in real-time via **Socket.IO**.

---

## Deployment

### Frontend:
- Deploy the frontend on **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

### Backend:
- Deploy the backend on **Heroku** or **Render.com**.
- Ensure that the database is securely configured using **MongoDB Atlas** (for MongoDB) or **ElephantSQL** (for PostgreSQL).

### Database:
- Use **MongoDB Atlas** for a NoSQL solution or **ElephantSQL** for a SQL-based solution.
- Store environment variables for database connection in `.env` files.

---

## Testing

### Unit Testing:
- Test user authentication, room allocation, and notification creation with tools like **Jest** or **Mocha**.

### End-to-End Testing:
- Simulate user interactions to verify the room interest and notification system.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Profile Management**: Allow candidates to update their room preferences and personal information.
- **Roommate Recommendations**: Suggest roommates based on previous history or preferences.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A management interface for admins to oversee room allocations and monitor user activity.
- **Mobile App**: Consider developing a mobile version using React Native for a seamless experience.

---

## Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Set up project, user registration, and authentication.
2. **Week 2**: Implement room allocation and room interest feature.
3. **Week 3**: Build notification system and integrate Socket.IO for real-time updates.
4. **Week 4**: Finalize UI, conduct testing, and deploy.

## Conclusion

This project provides an efficient way for hostel candidates to manage room swaps and receive notifications within the app itself. It improves the overall user experience by eliminating the need for emails and providing instant, in-app alerts. With scalability in mind, future features like roommate recommendations and a mobile app can enhance its usability.
